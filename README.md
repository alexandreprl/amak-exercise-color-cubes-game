<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Exercise

Given a warehouse divided in multiple areas and packages of different colors, the goal is to group packages of the same color in the same area.
To do that, multiple robots are available. Each robot can move to any area and pick up a package. The robot can then move to another area and drop the package.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Click on "Use this template" then "Create a new repository"
* Clone your new repository
* Open the project in your favorite IDE (Use open project in IntelliJ IDEA or Import Gradle Project in Eclipse)
* Run Launcher.main()

### Exercise

The exercise is to implement the robots' behavior to group packages of the same color in the same area.


Areas do not have a specific color, they can receive packages of any color.


Robots can carry up to 4 packages at the same time.

Robots do not have a specific color, they can pick up packages of any color.


The solution must work for A areas and C colors, with A >= C and any number of robots greater than 0.
The solution must support the addition/removal of robots, packages, colors, and areas at runtime.

### Initial state
- The warehouse is divided into A areas
- There are C colors
- There are R robots
- Each area has a random number of packages of random colors

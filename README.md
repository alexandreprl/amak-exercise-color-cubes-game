<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Exercise

Given a warehouse divided in multiple areas and cubes of different colors, the goal is to group cubes of the same color in the same area.
To do that, multiple robots are available. Each robot can move to any area and pick up a cube. The robot can then move to another area and drop the cube.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Click on "Use this template" then "Create a new repository"
* Clone your new repository
* Open the project in your favorite IDE (Use open project in IntelliJ IDEA or Import Gradle Project in Eclipse)
* Run Launcher.main()

### Exercise

The exercise is to implement the robots' behavior to group cubes of the same color in the same area.


Areas do not have a specific color, they can receive cubes of any color.


Robots can carry up to 4 cubes at the same time.

Robots do not have a specific color, they can pick up cubes of any color.


The solution must work for any number of areas (greater than or equal to number of colors), colors, robots (>0) and cubes.
The solution must support the addition/removal of robots, packages, colors, and areas at runtime.

### Initial state

- Each area has a random number of cubes of random colors
- Robots are placed randomly in an area of the warehouse

### Expected result

- All cubes of the same color are grouped in the same area
- An area only contains cubes of the same color
- Robots are not carrying any cube
